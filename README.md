# SIR_Final
This project was created to fulfill the requirements of my final project for Programming and Data Management at John's Hopkins University.
# Overview
This project uses 2023 data from the California Health and Human Services Agency (CalHHS). My analysis identifies hospitals and surgical procedures where post-surgical infection rates are higher than predicted or lack improvement over time. Predicted infection rates are based on standardized models from the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN).
The project seeks to support infection prevention efforts by highlighting underperforming facilities and areas for targeted oversight.
