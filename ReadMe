# Surgical Site Infections in California Hospitals (2023)

This project analyzes surgical site infection (SSI) rates across California hospitals, focusing on facilities and procedures compared to predicted infection rates.

## Overview

Using 2023 data from the California Health and Human Services Agency (CalHHS), this analysis identifies hospitals and surgical procedures and their post-surgical infection rates. These rates are compared other expected figures based on standardized models from the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN).

The project supports infection prevention efforts by highlighting underperforming facilities and risky procedures for targeted intervention and oversight.
