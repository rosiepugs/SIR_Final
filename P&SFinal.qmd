**Access**

All project files are available on GitHub: <https://github.com/rosiepugs/SIR_Final>

**Overview**

The data utilized for this project is titled “Surgical Site Infections (SSIs) for Operative Procedures in California Hospitals.” It is publicized on an annual basis by the California Department of Health and Human Services (CalHHS), which is overseen by the California Department of Public Health (CDPH).

CalHHS’ collects data on California hospitals to better understand patient outcomes for 28 distinct operative procedures. The outcomes are analyzed at a procedural and facility level, with a focus on the prevalence of infections post surgery. The Prevention National Healthcare Safety Network (NSHN) uses logistic regression models to predict the number of infections that would be expected based on specific procedure and hospital characteristics; these models are based on 2015 baseline data.  The 2022 actual infection rates are then compared against the predictions.

This analysis will rely on 2023 data, as it was the most recent complete year available for public use. 

**Purpose**

The purpose of this project is to conduct a data-informed assessment that can guide CalHHS in making strategic decisions about where to allocate resources, to aid in infection prevention efforts. Additionally, the analysis seeks to highlight facilities with consistently high post-surgical infection rates that may warrant deeper investigation, enhanced oversight, or targeted intervention to ensure adherence to appropriate clinical and safety standards.

**Data Citation**

**Unit of Observation**

Individual Surgical Procedures Conducted

**Number of Observations**

6,395

**Number of Variables**

20

**Key Variables and Definitions:**

**1) Operative Procedure:** There are 28 distinct procedures examined in this data. This variable identifies the name of the procedure (i.e. kidney surgery, cesarean section, etc.). Each procedure type is clinically defined and standardized to allow consistent tracking and comparison of infection rates across facilities.

**2)** **Facility Name:** This variable identifies the name of the healthcare facility where the surgical procedure was performed.

**3) Procedure Count:** This variable represents the total number of surgical procedures of a specific type performed at a given facility within the reporting year

**4) Infections Reported:** This variable indicates the number of surgery-associated infections that were documented and submitted by a facility following a specific operative procedure. It represents the observed count of infections within the monitored post-operative period (undefined).

**5) Infections Predicted:** The number of infections a facility would be predicted to have following a specific procedure. According to the National Health and Safety Network, predicted numbers are calculated "using procedure-specific risk adjustment logistic regression models based on 2015 national baseline data and that accounts for particular patient-level factors and hospital characteristics found to be significant predictors of SSI incidence." Precise patient-level factors and characteristics were not expanded upon.

**6) SIR:** SIR stands for Standardized Infection Rate and is a metric used to compare actual infections against those that were predicted to occur. SIR = observed infections/predicted infections.

-   1.0 means the number of observed infections is equal to the number predicted

-   Greater than 1.0 indicates more infections than predicted

-   Less than 1.0 indicates fewer infections than predicted

**7) SIR_2015:** This is the exact same as "SIR", but represents figures from 2015 for longitudinal comparisons.

**Conclusion:**

The charts and data below will support the following conclusions:

-   There are many facilities that perform very few surgeries on an annual basis

-   The worst (by SIR) facilities, in order by top 5 greatest SIR, with a minimum of 500 performed surgeries in the year 2022 are below. The first number in parenthesis is the number of surgical procedures performed in 2022, while the second number is the SIR.

    -   1\) Kaiser Foundation Hospital - San Leandro (772; 4.97)

    -   2\) Kaiser Foundation Hospital - Santa Rosa (559; 4.66)

    -   3\) Hoag Orthopedic Institute (868; 3.98)

    -   4\) Palomar (942; 3.36)

    -   5\) Desert Regional Medical Center (679; 3.20)

-   The best (by SIR) facilities, in order by top 5 lowest SIR, with a minimum of 500 performed surgeries in the year 2022 are below. The first number in parenthesis is the number of surgical procedures performed in 2022, while the second number is the SIR.

    -   1\) Adventist Health Glendale (3,301; 0.04)	

    -   2\) University of California Davis Medical Center (817, 0.08)

    -   3\) Palmdale Regional Medical Center (2,192, 0.09)

    -   4\) Saint John's Health Center (4,183, 0.09)

    -   5\) St. Francis Medical Center (2,337; 0.13)	

-   Many facilities had SIRs \> 1 and showed no improvement since 2015. Below are the top 5 with the greatest SIR based on the criteria that their SIR was equal to or worse than 2015:

    -   1\) Ridgecrest Regional Hospital

    -   2\) Watsonville Community Hospital

    -   3\) Kaiser Foundation Hospital - San Rafael

    -   4\) Tenet Health Central Coast Twin Cities Community Hospital

    -   5\) Oroville Hospital

-   The top 5 procedures with the highest rate of infection (SIR) are as follows:

    -   1\) Exploratory Abdominal Surgery (Laparotomy) (1.23)

    -   2\) Kidney Transplant (1.18)

    -   3\) Knee Prosthesis (1.14)

    -   4\) Gallbladder Surgery (1.01)

    -   5\) Cesarean Section (0.97)

-   For these top 5 "risky" procedures, below are the facilities with the highest SIRs:

    -   1\) Exploratory Abdominal Surgery (Laparotomy) - Kaiser Foundation

    -   2\) Kidney Transplant - Alta Bates Summit Medical Center

    -   3\) Knee Prosthesis - USC Verdugo Hills Hospital

    -   4\) Gallbladder Surgery - Sharp Memorial Hospital

    -   5\) Cesarean Section - Ridgecrest Regional Hospital

-   

Based on the findings outlined above, I would implore the California Department of Health and Human Services to provide:

-   Better training for medical professionals performing exploratory abdominal surgery, kidney transplants, and knee prosthesis (these were the top 3 of the top 5 surgical procedures that fell significantly above the 1.0 SIR threshold).

-   Increased funding and the allocation of top surgeons to Ridgecrest Regional Hospital, Watsonville Community Hospital, Kaiser Foundation Hospital (San Rafael location), Tenet Health Central Coast Twin Cities Community Hospital, and Oroville Hospital. These facilities are exceeding 1.0 SIR and have not shown any improvement in SIRs since 2015.

**Data Limitations**

	CalHHS does not define a specific post-surgical time frame during which infections are monitored for exploratory analysis. Furthermore, the dataset does not include detailed clinical information beyond the procedure name, making it impossible to assess the complexity of individual cases. More complex procedures may inherently carry a higher risk of infection. It is possible that the “infections predicted” takes these factors into account, but that is not explicitly stated in the data dictionary. In addition, key patient-level factors known to influence infection risk—such as smoking status, body weight, lifestyle behaviors, and access to post-operative care or home support—are not captured. Lastly, although not a key focus of the study, details of the infections are not provided. Thus, it is impossobile to distinguish between cases that resulted in very serious, or life-ending infections, and those that were easily treated. These omissions represent significant confounding variables that limit the ability to draw fully informed conclusions from the data.
